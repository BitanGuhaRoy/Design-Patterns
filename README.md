Design Patterns in Java:  

This repository contains well-structured, real-world examples of various design patterns implemented in Java. Each pattern is designed to follow best practices, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean code.

What Are Design Patterns?  
Design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems. They help developers write code that is reusable, efficient, and scalable.  

Design patterns are broadly categorized into:  

Creational Patterns – For object creation mechanisms (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Builder).  
Structural Patterns – For class and object composition (e.g., Adapter, Decorator, Composite).  
Behavioral Patterns – For object communication (e.g., Strategy, Observer).
